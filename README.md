# LinkTo
LinkTo Dynamic DNS is a dynamic DNS service.

If you have a dynamic IP address and are worried about it changing often, try LinkTo!

LinkTo uses the LinkShort codebase and creates an updatable shortened URL of your choice. You can run a Unix/Linux/Mac script to update the URL or even have a CRON job to do it for you!

## Why LinkTo

LinkTo is free. 100% free. And unlike many other services, LinkTo is open-sourced. Super easy. Super fast. Super simple.

We don't try to get you to pay exorbitant prices just because you don't have a static IP address. Instead, we offer this service for free.

We would like to thank you for using LinkTo and supporting open-sourced projects.
